About me
=====

I am a Ph.D. student in the Computer Science Department at [Yale University](https://cpsc.yale.edu/), advised by Prof. [Dragomir Radev](http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/radev/). I obtained my M.S. in Computer Science at [Columbia University SEAS](https://engineering.columbia.edu/), advised by Prof. [Michael Collins](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~mcollins/). 
<!-- (details of my past research can be found [here](https://linyongnan.github.io/research/)): -->

* I'm mainly interested in **natural language processing**, particularly the following topics:
  * High-fidelity data-to-text generation
  * Semantic parsing, question answering and logical reasoning
  * Language modeling
  * Neural-Symbolic learning
  * Transfer learning across domains and languages

<!-- * **Adversarial machine learning, robustness and interpretability** of machine learning systems. -->

Previously, I received my bachelor degree in mathematics and computer science (*Summa cum laude*) from [College of William & Mary](https://www.wm.edu/) in 2018.
