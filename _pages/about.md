About me
=====

I am a Ph.D. student in the Computer Science Department at [Yale University](https://cpsc.yale.edu/), advised by Prof. [Dragomir Radev](http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/radev/). I obtained my M.S. in Computer Science at [Columbia University SEAS](https://engineering.columbia.edu/), advised by Prof. [Michael Collins](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~mcollins/). My research interests include the following:
<!-- (details of my past research can be found [here](https://linyongnan.github.io/research/)): -->

* **Natural language processing**, with particular interests in high-fidelity data-to-text generation, semantic parsing, language modeling, and transfer learning across domains and languages.

* Applying deep learning methods to **healthcare and biotechnology**, in particular, I have worked on medical image analysis and protein folding problem (3D structure prediction) using deep learning.

<!-- * **Adversarial machine learning, robustness and interpretability** of machine learning systems. -->

Previously, I received my bachelor degree in mathematics and computer science (*Summa cum laude*) from [College of William & Mary](https://www.wm.edu/) in 2018.
