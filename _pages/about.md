About me
=====
_____

Hello there! My name is Linyong Nan, and I'm currently in my final-year of Ph.D. studies in Computer Science at [Yale University](https://cpsc.yale.edu/). I have the pleasure of working under the guidance of Prof. [Arman Cohan](https://armancohan.com/).

My research explores the dynamic field of text generation from multi-modal knowledge sources. These sources include texts, web tables, databases, knowledge graphs, images and more. I've delved into several exciting topics in this field: **Augmented LLMs/Agents** (like RAG and tool-augmented LLMs), **Question Answering** from tables/databases, **Code Generation**, **Data-to-Text** and **Summarization**. 

A pivotal aspect of my work is enhancing the **faithfulness** and **reliability** of LLMs/Agents augmented with retrieval and tools. This is particularly crucial for tasks that require the retrieval of extensive, often time-sensitive knowledge from verified sources and are reasoning intensive. I'm particularly drawn to the neural-symbolic approach for achieving these enhancements, which involve generating formal language (code) as intermediate steps. This allows for greater transparency in how LLMs perform information retrieval, reasoning and aggregation, ultimately **fostering human trust in the generated content**. 

My journey at Yale began under the mentorship of the remarkable Prof. [Dragomir Radev](http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/radev/), who sadly is no longer with us. Drago was the one who recognized and nurtured my passion for NLP research, bringing me into the Ph.D. program. During my first three years at Yale, Drago provided me with invaluable guidance, warmth, unwavering support, and inspiration that have deeply influenced my academic and personal growth. Reflecting on those transformative years, my heart is filled with deep gratitude for Drago. His influence extends far beyond the academic, touching the very core of who I am today. I am profoundly grateful for his wisdom, kindness, and the indelible mark he left on my life and career.

Before Yale, I obtained my M.S. in Computer Science at [Columbia University SEAS](https://engineering.columbia.edu/), advised by Prof. [Michael Collins](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~mcollins/). My undergraduate years were spent at the [College of William & Mary](https://www.wm.edu/), where I graduated *Summa cum laude* in 2018 with double majors in Mathematics and Computer Science.

Miscellaneous

When I'm not immersed in research, I find joy in various hobbies. I'm an avid reader and love exploring new places through travel. Music is another passion of mine, and I enjoy playing the piano, especially classical and jazz pieces.

I grew up bilingual, speaking both Mandarin Chinese and Korean.

Hackathons are another area where I love to engage and challenge myself:

* At PennApps XVIII in Philadelphia, PA, 2018, our team won the Best VR/AR Hack. We developed **ARound**, an iOS app that enhances city exploration through a phone camera with Augmented Reality (AR) features.
* We were the First Runner-up at TribeHacks IV in Williamsburg, VA, 2018, with our innovative project **Cockpit**. This program enables real-time drone control using hand gestures.
