About me
=====

I am a Ph.D. student in the Computer Science Department at [Yale University](https://cpsc.yale.edu/), advised by Prof. [Dragomir Radev](http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/radev/). 
<!-- (details of my past research can be found [here](https://linyongnan.github.io/research/)): -->

My research aims to build natural language interface to structured knowledge sources, such as databases, knowledge graphs and web tables. I'm interested primarily in tasks that involve text generation from data (**Data-to-Text**) or extracting structured data from texts (**Text-to-Data**) in **QA** or **dialogue** settings. For data-to-text, I'm interested in converting natural language to formal language for querying structured knowledge (**Semantic Parsing**), building systems that can perform **reasoning** and generate faithful sentences, and designing evaluation metrics (**Fact Verification**). For text-to-data, I'm interested **Open Information Extraction** and **Coreference Resolution**.

<!-- * **Adversarial machine learning, robustness and interpretability** of machine learning systems. -->

Previously, I obtained my M.S. in Computer Science at [Columbia University SEAS](https://engineering.columbia.edu/), advised by Prof. [Michael Collins](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~mcollins/). I also received my bachelor degree in mathematics and computer science (*Summa cum laude*) from [College of William & Mary](https://www.wm.edu/) in 2018.
