About me
=====

I am a recently graduated CS master student at [Columbia University SEAS](https://engineering.columbia.edu/), advised by Prof. [Michael Collins](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~mcollins/). My research interests include the following (details of my past research can be found [here](https://linyongnan.github.io/research/)):

* **Natural language processing**, with particular interests in language models, text generation, transfer learning across domains and languages, and language grounding to vision and control.

* Applying deep learning methods to **healthcare and biotechnology**, in particular, I have worked on medical image analysis and protein folding problem (3D structure prediction) using deep learning.

* **Adversarial machine learning, robustness and interpretability** of machine learning systems.

Previously, I received my bachelor degree in mathematics and computer science (*Summa cum laude*) from [College of William & Mary](https://www.wm.edu/) in 2018.
