Outside of research, I enjoy reading, travel, playing piano (classical and jazz) and building cool stuffs.

I'm bilingual, my native languages are Mandarin Chinese and Korean.  

I also like participating in hackathons and won two prizes last year:

* Best VR/AR Hack at PennApps XVIII, Philadelphia PA, 2018

  **ARound**: an iOS app that allows user to explore cities through phone camera with Augmented Reality (AR) features.
* First Runner-up at TribeHacks IV, Williamsburg VA, 2018

  **Cockpit**: a program that allows people to control drones with hand in real-time.
